## :information_source: About

This library has a documentation but still is meant for my personal usage. I do use it in production myself though, but have not yet documented it properly.

> [!NOTE]  
> I use this library to create a demo android activity in many of my open source libraries as well as for all my own desktop apps.
> It's developing and in usage by myself, but it's not documented currently.
